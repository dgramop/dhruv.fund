# The Slushy Fund
The Slushy Fund supports prototyping for George Mason University[^1] students, with no expectation of repayment.

The application takes less than a minute, and each reimbursement should take less than a minute to file. 

The fund is intended to operate at the speed of prototyping, not paperwork. 

## Logistics

<details>
<summary><h3>Application (once)</h3></summary>
Via [LinkedIn DM to Dhruv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgramop/), explain:
- What are you building?
- Why are you building it?
- Send a picture of your progress so far (even if its just a napkin sketch)

Just add me on LinkedIn and DM me your responses. You can also reach out - I'm in the University Scholars discord and the MIX discord.

If I have more questions, I'll follow up on a LinkedIn DM. It shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to apply.

I'm setting aside a total of $2,000 for all applicants combined, for the 2025-2026 academic year. Not much, but we'll see how far we can stretch it!
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Send Reciepts (for every reimbursement)</h3></summary>
Every purchase must be backed by a reciept you send me over LinkedIn, which I will then reimburse.

You can apply for particular purchase in advance. This way we can set aside the money + let you know that you expense is good.

You can also do cowboy reimbursements (where you buy the thing and then submit the reciept instead of asking in advance), but there's a risk I'll say no, run out of money, or change the rules.

Usual disclaimer that I reserve the right to say to no for any reason or no reason at all. Or to cut you off if you're burning cash too fast without sharing your progress (even if its back-to-back failures)!

<summary><h2>Rules<h2></summary>
### No academic projects (classwork or funded research)
Things you're "required" to build (for class, for work, or for your thesis) can be cool, but that's not what this fund is for.
There are tons of grants and funds already in place for this.

This money is intended to fund passion projects.

### You still own everything
You own your intellectual property, and you own the stuff you bought (even after I reimburse it).

However, you grant me a license to share the photos of your work, descriptions of your project etc. This is so I can build a case for this sort of "ad-hoc" funding

<summary><h2>Q&A</h2></summary>

## What are some examples of things I can use this for?
- Printer filament, and other supplies
- Items used and consumed in the development of your project (microcontrollers, sensors, fasteners, modules etc.)

Please use this money in good-faith towards actually achieving your project. This fund has few rules - let's try to keep it that way!


## Why am I doing this?
In the grand scheme of alumni contributions, my $2,000 is a rounding error.

There are many good reasons to contribute straight to the university. There is no mechanism I'm aware of that directly disperses funds to students in a way that keeps up with the speed of prototyping.

It probably won't last all year.

I'm not sure I'm going to do this again next year, let's see how this one goes! 

## What about the Student Funding Board (SFB)? Aren't they unable to actually spend all their money?
GMU's existing Student Fund is "underallocated", but continuges to deny legitimate requests.

Their contrived process requires RSO's to fill out multi-page rubrics, take mandatory online trainings, review [50-slide presentations](https://si.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FM-1-5-presentation-2017-2018_January-2018-Version.pdf), and wait several weeks only to recieve a denial.

Whether by design or by circumstance, the SFB is unable to effectively fund hardware STEM projects that RSOs come together to build.

I want to bring a culture of saying "yes" to non-academic STEM project funding in the MIX.

It should't take weeks to request a $50 reimbursement and signatures from the entire GMU finance deparment for a legimiate request for microcontrollers to be denied.
De-minimis purchases of parts used-and-consumed by a project should not require inventory or on-campus presence.

## Why the whole reimbursement thing?
If I give out a block grant, I can't reallocate that money to another project (if, for example, the recipient(s) loses interest in their project and no longer needs parts)

## Whose money is this?
I get it, most funds are named after dead people that did great things. I am neither dead, nor have I done anything all that great.
I have no plans to be dead, but some constraints are hard to design around.

I was in the class of 2024, where I got a major in computer science and jetissoned my second math major to get into industry.

I was a teaching assistant (TA) for CS department. After almost unionizing the TA's because our $10/hr stipend was left unpaid nearly for over 3 months, I left this job with some of my friends to start https://passcs.io.

<summary>How I lost faith in back-office payroll/finance types at GMU</summary>
I earned my despise for back-office bean-counters after the following conversation with payroll:

| | |
| -- | -- |
| Me | "Yes, I know you said it's the computer science department that hasn't done their paperwork. The last time I called them, they said they've done the paperwork and you haven't processed it. We've tried waiting weeks, we've tried waiting months. So who do I belive" | 
| Payroll | "Well I can't do anything until they send us their paperwork" | 
| Me | "Can you follow up with them and ask them for their paperwork? There's more than a dozen of us that haven't been paid yet" | 
| Payroll | "I'm not sure, they would have to send us paperwork" | 
| Me | "Is the problem that you don't know who to contact? I can put you in touch with the right people in CS department" | 
| Payroll | "We're just going to have to wait for CS department to send us their paperwork" | 
| Me | "It's not clear that they even know they owe you paperwork. Can /you/ contact them" | 
| Payroll | "It's not my job" | 
| Me | "We could really use an advocate here to see this through. There a lot of people that haven't been paid yet. Will you be our advocate?" | 
| Payroll | "... Sorry that's just not my job" | 
| Me | "I figured. So I'm actually in Finley lot next to the USPS mail dropbox" | 
| Payroll | "..." |
| Me | "In my hand I've got filled copies of the wage complaint form adressed to the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry from 6 of the TA's that haven't been paid yet, along with my own" |
| Me | "It sounds like payroll is having some resourcing problems - maybe you're understaffed if you can't do your job? A Department of Labor and Industry investigation may help your head of payroll (name drop) mobilize more resources for your department" |
| Payroll | "Alight, just hang on. Let me talk to my boss and get in touch with CS department. I'll make sure you hear back by the end of the week" |

When payroll/fund administrators are so far separated from the day-to-day affairs of the University, and don't care to take ownership for their results, you end up with an ineffective high-overhead system.

In the case of SFB, there isn't even a hard legal obligation to dispurse funds. This is why I don't feel that my tiny allocation is redundant.

If anybody cares to figure out how to change this, I'm all ears. Too late for me, maybe not for a future class?

While I was a resident advisor, I got to watch the de-facto organizer of my floor rally his neighbors to build various applied engineering projects, including a fixed-wing UAS.

The following semester, after I moved to San Francisco for tech work, I had the privilege of seeing those same residents at [Open Sauce](https://opensauce.com/), where they presented their work.
