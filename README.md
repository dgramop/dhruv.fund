# The Slushy Fund
The Slushy Fund supports prototyping for George Mason University[^1] students, with no expectation of repayment.

The application takes less than a minute, and each reimbursement should take less than a minute to file. 

The fund is intended to operate at the speed of prototyping, not paperwork. 

## Logistics

<details>
<summary><h3>Application (once)</h3></summary>

Via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgramop ">LinkedIn DM to Dhruv</a> explain:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>What are you building?</li>
  <li>Why are you building it?</li>
  <li>Send a picture of your progress so far (even if its just a napkin sketch)</li>
</ul>

Just add me on LinkedIn and DM me your responses. You can also reach out via Discord - I'm in the University Scholars server and the MIX server.<br/><br/>

If I have more questions, I'll follow up. It shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to apply.<br/><br/>

I'm setting aside a total of $2,000 for all applicants combined, for the 2025-2026 academic year. Not much, but we'll see how far we can stretch it!
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Send Reciepts (for every reimbursement)</h3></summary>
Every purchase must be backed by a reciept you send me over LinkedIn, which I will then reimburse.<br/><br/>

You can apply for particular purchase in advance. This way we can set aside the money + let you know that you expense is good.<br/><br/>

You can also do cowboy reimbursements (where you buy the thing and then submit the reciept instead of asking in advance), but there's a risk I'll say no, run out of money to allocate, or improve the rules.<br/><br/>

Usual disclaimer that I reserve the right to say to no for any reason or no reason at all.

<details>
<summary><h3>Rules</h3></summary>

<h4>No academic projects (classwork or funded research)</h4>
Things you're "required" to build (for class, for work, or for your thesis) can be cool, but that's not what this fund is for.<br/>
There are tons of grants and funds already in place for this.<br/><br/>

This money is intended to fund passion projects.<br/><br/>

<h4>You still own everything</h4>
You own your intellectual property, and you own the stuff you bought (even after I reimburse it).<br/><br/>

However, you grant me a license to share the photos of your work & undetailed descriptions of your project. This is so I can build a case for this sort of "ad-hoc" funding<br/>

<details>
<summary><h3>Q&A</h3></summary>

<h4>What are some examples of things I can use this for?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Printer filament, and other supplies</li>
<li>Items used and consumed in the development of your project (microcontrollers, sensors, fasteners, modules etc.)</li>
</ul>
Please use this money in good-faith towards actually achieving your project. This fund has few rules - let's try to keep it that way! <br/><br/>

<h4>Why?</h4>
In the grand scheme of alumni contributions, my $2,000 is a rounding error.<br/><br/>

There are many good reasons to contribute straight to the university. There is no mechanism I'm aware of that directly disperses funds to students in a way that keeps up with the speed of prototyping.<br/><br/>

This fund probably won't last all year.<br/><br/>

I'm not sure I'm going to do this again next year, let's see how this one goes! <br/><br/>

<h4>What about the Student Funding Board (SFB)? Aren't they unable to actually spend all their money?</h4>
GMU's existing Student Fund is "underallocated", but still denies most legitimate prototyping-related requests, largely due to tracability & inventory of all purchased items.<br/><br/>

Their contrived process requires RSO's to fill out multi-page rubrics, take mandatory online trainings, review <a href="https://si.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FM-1-5-presentation-2017-2018_January-2018-Version.pdf">50-slide presentations</a>, and wait several weeks only to recieve a denial.<br><br/>

Whether by cynical state regulation or by internal bureaucracy/politics, the SFB is unable to effectively fund hardware STEM projects that RSOs come together to build.<br/><br/>

I want to bring a culture of saying "yes" to non-academic STEM project funding in the MIX.<br/><br/>

It should't take weeks to request a $50 reimbursement and signatures from the entire GMU finance deparment for a legimiate request for microcontrollers to be denied.<br/><br/>

De-minimis purchases of parts used-and-consumed by a project should not require on-campus inventory presence.<br/><br/>

<h4>Why reimbursements?</h4>
If I give out a block grant, I can't reallocate that money to another project (if, for example, the recipient(s) loses interest in their project and no longer needs parts)<br/><br/>

<h4>Whose money is this?</h4>
My name is dhruv
<br/>
I was in the class of 2024, where I got a major in computer science and jetissoned my second math major to get into industry. I was proud<br/>
<br/>
I was a teaching assistant (TA) for CS department. After almost unionizing the TA's because our $10/hr stipend was left unpaid nearly for over 3 months, I left this job with some of my friends to start https://passcs.io. I was able to achieve several financial goals through this buisness, until I handed over the company to another tutor<br/>
<br/>
This experience created my despise for the back-office bean-counters that do not meaningfully improve the student or faculty experience. Hot take: if the bean-counters can't effectively discharge the University's legal obligations, how can we expect them to effectively administer innovation & academic funding?<br/><br/>
<!--<details>
<summary>Aside: How I lost faith in back-office payroll/finance types at GMU</summary>
I earned my despise for back-office bean-counters after the following conversation with payroll:<br/>
<br/>

| | |
| -- | -- |
| Me | "Yes, I know you said it's the computer science department that hasn't done their paperwork. The last time I called them, they said they've done the paperwork and you haven't processed it. We've tried waiting weeks, we've tried waiting months. So who do I belive" | 
| Payroll | "Well I can't do anything until they send us their paperwork" | 
| Me | "Can you follow up with them and ask them for their paperwork? There's more than a dozen of us that haven't been paid yet" | 
| Payroll | "I'm not sure, they would have to send us paperwork" | 
| Me | "Is the problem that you don't know who to contact? I can put you in touch with the right people in CS department" | 
| Payroll | "We're just going to have to wait for CS department to send us their paperwork" | 
| Me | "It's not clear that they even know they owe you paperwork. Can /you/ contact them" | 
| Payroll | "It's not my job" | 
| Me | "We could really use an advocate here to see this through. There a lot of people that haven't been paid yet. Will you be our advocate?" | 
| Payroll | "... Sorry that's just not my job" | 
| Me | "I figured. So I'm actually in Finley lot next to the USPS mail dropbox" | 
| Payroll | "..." |
| Me | "In my hand I've got filled copies of the wage complaint form adressed to the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry from 6 of the TA's that haven't been paid yet, along with my own" |
| Me | "It sounds like payroll is having some resourcing problems - maybe you're understaffed if you can't do your job? A Department of Labor and Industry investigation may help your head of payroll (name drop) mobilize more resources for your department" |
| Payroll | "Alight, just hang on. Let me talk to my boss and get in touch with CS department. I'll make sure you hear back by the end of the week" |

With few exceptions, everyone was paid by the following week.

When payroll/fund administrators are so far separated from the day-to-day affairs of the University, burdened by state regulation, and don't care to take ownership for their results, we end up with an ineffective high-overhead system.

Even in the case of a hard legal obligation to pay employees, our bean-counters coudn't hack it. In the case of SFB, there isn't even a hard legal obligation to dispurse funds. This is why I don't feel that my tiny allocation is redundant.

If anybody cares to figure out how to change this, I'm all ears. Too late for me, maybe not for a future class?

While I was a resident advisor, I got to watch the de-facto organizer of my floor rally his neighbors to build various applied engineering projects, including a fixed-wing UAS.<br/><br/>

The following semester, after I moved to San Francisco for tech work, I had the privilege of seeing those same residents at <a href="https://opensauce.com/">Open Sauce</a>, where they presented their work.<br/><br/>

I have several other stories of projects those students built in the dorms, in spite of hurdles created by University Life regulation and a finite budget. These are the kinds of projects I want to enable, and that bring glory to our alma-mater in the eyes of modern industry.
